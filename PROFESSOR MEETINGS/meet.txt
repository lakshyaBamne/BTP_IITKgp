TASK-1 : Reproduce the results of the Research paper (tentatively in one month)

-> Revise Hyperbolic Partial Differential Equations
-> [DONE] Solve Assignment on Hyperbolic PDE schemes (Lax-Friedrics Scheme)
-> [READ ABSTRACT & INTRODUCTION] Read given Research paper 
   =>Semi-definite central-upwind Rankine-Hugoniot schemes for 
     hyperbolic systems of conservation laws

TASK-1 (revised) : Reproducing the results of 1D Euler equation using the 
		   schemes provided in section 2.1 of the research paper.
		   
	           => DEADLINE : (3 Weeks) 10th June 2023

-> Review the 1D Euler system given in section 4.1 (One Dimensional Examples)
-> Convert the system into it's Compact Form
-> Convert the system into it's QuasiLinear Form
-> Develop and evaluate the 3x3 Jacobian of the 1D Euler system and 
   find the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of this system.
-> now review and understand the Fortran90 code of numerical scheme in 
   section 2.1 provided by Prof. N. K. Garg in the meet.
-> Reproduce the results and write new code in C++.

TASK-2  : Implement the Numerical Schemes for solving the Time 
	  Dependent Euler Equation in both 1D and 2D.
	
	  => DEADLINE : End of July (i.e., before returning to campus)
